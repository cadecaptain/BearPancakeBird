# BearPancakeBird
Our game, Bear Pancake Bird, was created with the initial intention of combining all three of the theme words we got for this lab. In the game, you are a bear trying to swat away at the birds who are trying to peck at your pancakes. You have no other choice but to fend off the birds with the very pancakes you are trying to keep them from going towards. As the birds attack the pancakes, as well as when you hit the birds with the pancake you are holding, it gets slightly smaller, and you may have to get another pancake to fight the birds. When you swat at a bird with a pancake, the goal is to send it flying into one of the trees on the left and right side of the screen. This will kill the bird and earn you a point. The pancakes are constantly being made by the stove for you to use against the birds. The aesthetics of the game are intended to be very bright and bold, to further drive home the wacky premise of the game itself. The red color of the birds and the blood of the birds are supposed to pop out of the screen, to indicate they are an enemy of you in the complementary colored green forest. When writing the game, we initially had a struggle of figuring out how the birds should move, originally making the birds go one of two ways back and forth. We then decided to change this and make them try and go towards a pancake. We also had some trouble in making the art we found mesh well with the way we had coded the game and the arm, and eventually had to move the arm to where it was floating next to you instead of being attached to you. It was nice however, seeing the art being added to the sprites and making the game come to life. Also, the addition of little things like the trail that follows the bird and the blood you see from the tree/bird collision really helped the aesthetics and fun factor of this game. Besides the blood, which was made by us, we got the rest of the art from opengameart.org:
